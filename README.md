# Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Diabetes Patients Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of identifying retinopathy in medical images. Leveraging deep learning techniques to accurately classify retinal images, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment. <br>




## Project Description

This application automates the early-stage detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning and computer vision. It analyzes retinal fundus images to provide accurate, consistent, and efficient identification of DR, supporting early intervention and personalized treatment. By leveraging these techniques, it addresses challenges posed by subjective assessments and manual labor in existing methods. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) model achieves an impressive accuracy and a 96% recall score, ensuring effective detection of diabetic retinopathy cases amidst rising diabetes prevalence and ophthalmologist shortages. <br>




## Objectives (Aim & Goals of this Project)

- Automate the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using machine learning and computer vision.

- Support early intervention by providing timely and reliable screening results.

- Reduce reliance on subjective assessments and manual labor for DR diagnosis.

- Address challenges posed by the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the shortage of ophthalmologists.

- Develop a robust and scalable system for DR detection.




## Features

- Upload single or batches of retinal fundus images for diabetic retinopathy (DR) analysis.

- Utilize machine learning and computer vision techniques for analysis.

- Display accurate detection results with confidence levels indicating the presence or absence of DR.

- Provide percentage levels to indicate the model's confidence in its predictions.

- Capability for signing in and signing up.

- Implement SQL as the backend for storing and retrieving patient data.

- Store prediction information for tracking and download prediction reports in PDF format.

- User-friendly interface.

- Ensure user privacy and security of data.
